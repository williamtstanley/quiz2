almost forgot to inclue a sql queary to do a count of each departments tickets

SELECT department, COUNT(department) AS department_count
FROM support_tickets
GROUP BY department



Struggled with getting kaminari to work for about 2 hours. No idea how to fix it. I can get search working. I can get pagination working but combining them together proved to be beyond me.

cest la vi. I will ask for help getting it working later today perhaps.
